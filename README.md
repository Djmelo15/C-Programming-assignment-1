# C++ Coding Assignment

* This coding assignment was done for my intro to programming class, where I had to code a program that is designed to display the positive divisors of positive integers supplied by the user. The program will repeatedly prompt you to enter a positive integer. Each time you enter a positive integer, the program will print all the divisors of your integer in a column, in decreasing order.
  
* Additionally, I created a program where the user selects values for 6 resistors, and the output voltage of the circuit must be 15 Volts when the input voltage is -2 Volts. The circuit will operate correctly only when the six resistors satisfy the following equation: ((R1+R2)*R4*R6)/((R3+R4)*R1*R5)=7.5


# What I Learned

* This was the first language I learned, so this assignment not only helped me get used to C++, but also introduced me to the world of coding.
